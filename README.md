This is a rudimentary search crawler and indexer I built as a project while learning Python around the beginning of 2012. It was part of the early [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Python curriculum which was free at the time.

There is nothing useful here, but I am uploading to GitHub for archival purposes as I find it fun and nostalgic to look back at this occasionally.
